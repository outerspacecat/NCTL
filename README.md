# NCTL 

#### The Normal Compaction Trend Line (NCTL) is used to determine pore pressure, specifically areas of overpressure, using an effective stress method. Because the effective stress increases with depth, the porosity decreases with depth. The effect of an increase in pore pressure below a certain depth, is a divergence from the normal hydrostatic pressure. Shown below as a dotted line ---

#### In general, effective stress methods must be calibrated, preferably using log data. However, they can also be calibrated empirically using approaches similar to those used to select trend lines, and they account explicitly for local changes in overburden and other stresses. The equation plotted in Fig. 4 is an example of relationships of the form

#### Athy first proposed this type of relationship in 1930, also proposing values for the parameters. Use of Athy’s original parameters is not recommended because they were based on analysis of overconsolidated shales from Oklahoma and thus are not applicable to young sediments. An appropriate algorithm for Athy’s method is to solve the following set of equations.

#### and f is the acoustic formation factor and is derived by calibration; Δtma is the matrix transit time. This type of relationship allows extension to account for effects such as cementation and thermal transformations by modifying the functional form of the exponent.
#### Deep sedimentary formations often exhibit pore pressures that exceed hydrostatic levels, sometimes surpassing double the normal pressure. Failure to accurately anticipate these abnormal pressures before drilling can lead to severe incidents like well blowouts and mud volcanoes. .... TBC
